# ‚ú® Kichu's Quantum Portfolio ‚ú®

Welcome, traveler, to the source code dimension of my personal portfolio website! This isn't just any portfolio; it's a journey through the quantum foam of web development, built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and a sprinkle of digital stardust. üåå

## ü§î What is this Sorcery?

This project is my digital playground, showcasing my skills, projects, and a perhaps unhealthy obsession with cool visual effects. It features:

*   A mind-bending **Neural Network background** powered by React Three Fiber.
*   A **"Quantum" theme** that shifts colors and styles as you scroll (cuz why not?).
*   A **custom "Quantum Cursor"** that jitters with probability (kinda maybe).
*   Smooth scrolling and animations using Framer Motion and GSAP.
*   Detailed sections for About Me, Skills, Projects, Education, and Contact.
*   Responsive design that looks decent on most devices (probably).

## üöÄ Summoning the Dev Server (Getting Started)

Want to tinker with the quantum realm yourself? Follow these ancient commands:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kichu12348/kichu.git
    cd kichu
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:** (Choose your package manager spell)
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

4.  **Open your browser portal:** Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (Note the custom port 8080!)

You can start meddling by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates faster than you can say "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle"!

## üõ†Ô∏è The Alchemist's Toolkit (Tech Stack)

This project was forged with:

*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
*   **UI Library:** [React](https://react.dev/)
*   **3D Graphics:** [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction), [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
*   **Animation:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) (with ScrollTrigger)
*   **Styling:** CSS Modules, [Geist Font](https://vercel.com/font)
*   **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
*   **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint (configured via `eslint.config.mjs`)

## üåå Deploying to the Cosmos (Vercel)

The easiest way to deploy this cosmic creation is using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme). It's like hitting the "make it live" button for the internet.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more arcane deployment knowledge.

## üôè A Word from the Creator

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore, break things (locally!), or get inspired. If you find a bug or have a cool idea, don't hesitate to open an issue or PR (though I might be lost in another dimension).

*(P.S. im betmen)* ü¶á

*May your code compile and your bugs be shallow.* üëæ
